            Learn Enough to be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
            <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take
            command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes everything
            error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing. We believe there
            are <strong> at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from learning technical sophistication,
            probably more. To join our movement, <a href="https://learnenough.com/email"> sign up for our official email
